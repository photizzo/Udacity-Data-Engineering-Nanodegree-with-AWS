# Course 2 - Could Data Warehouses
Gain experience in a wide range of skills, including:
* Data warehouse architecture
* Extracting, transforming, and loading data (ETL)
* Cloud data warehouses
* AWS Redshift
* Amazon S3

## Lesson 1 - Introduction to Data Warehouses
Learn the business case for data warehouses as well as architecture, extracting, transforming, and loading data, data modelling, and data warehouse technologies.
* Explain how OLAP may support certain business users better than OLTP
* Implement ETL for OLAP Transformations with SQL
* Describe Data Warehouse Architecture
* Describe OLAP cube from facts and dimensions to slice, dice, roll-up, and drill down operations
* Implement OLAP cube from facts and dimensions to slice, dice, roll-up, and drill down 
* Compare columnar vs. row-oriented approaches
* Implement columnar vs. row-oriented approaches

## Lesson 2 - ELT and Data Warehouse Technology in the Cloud
Learn about ELT, the differences between ETL and ELT, and general cloud data warehouse technologies.
* Explain the differences between ETL and ELT
* Differentiate scenarios where ELT is preferred over ETL
* Implement ETL for OLAP Transformations with SQL
* Select appropriate cloud data storage solutions 
* Select appropriate cloud pipeline solutions 
* Select appropriate cloud data warehouse solutions 

## Lesson 3 - AWS Data Technologies
Learn about AWS Services and how to set up Amazon S3, IAM, VPC, EC2, and RDS. Build a Redshift data warehouse cluster and learn how to interact with it.
* Describe AWS data warehouse services and technologies 
* Create and configure AWS Storage Resources
* Create and configure AWS Redshift Resources
* Implement infrastructure as code for Redshift on AWS

## Lesson 4 - Implementing Data Warehouses on AWS
* Describe Redshift data warehouse architecture
* Run ETL process to extract data from AWS S3 into Redshift 
* Design optimized tables by selecting appropriate distribution styles and sorting keys 


## [Project - Cloud Data Warehouse](./Project%202-Data%20Warehouse/)
Build an ETL pipeline that extracts data from S3, stages data in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for an analytics team.
